  I bought this because it looked good in the photos. What I received looks rather average. Wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

    Nice quality mask but no nose clip
  
",Reviewed in India on 14 June 2020,"









  
  
    
  It‚Äôs of no use against Corona as It doesn‚Äôt have a nose clip so the upper nose area is kind of open.No perfect fit. Though the material is good, soft n breathable.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  These masks do not fit!! These do not fit anyone at all - not me, my husband, mom - we all have very different head sizes and even then these are way too loose. Reviews mention them being a bit tight so I'm thinking these differ batch to batch - making them a bit of a gamble. Would not recommend

Reviews mention them being a bit tight so I'm thinking these differ batch to batch - making them a bit of a gamble. Would not recommend

  I bought this because it looked good in the photos. What I received looks rather average. Wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  I bought this because it looked good in the photos. What I received looks rather average. Wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  I bought this because it looked good in the photos. What I received looks rather average. Wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  It‚Äôs of no use against Corona as It doesn‚Äôt have a nose clip so the upper nose area is kind of open.No perfect fit. Though the material is good, soft n breathable.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.

Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

  I bought this because it looked good in the photos. What I received looks rather average. Wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. Breathing through it is very laboured. If you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. At 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. I'll have to replace this with something else now.

  These masks do not fit!! These do not fit anyone at all - not me, my husband, mom - we all have very different head sizes and even then these are way too loose. Reviews mention them being a bit tight so I'm thinking these differ batch to batch - making them a bit of a gamble. Would not recommend

  It is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.It does not have a nose clip. So, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. The fitting is also not good. Might fit for people with broad faces.I used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. So, the filter is clearly not good. Doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.Don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.Ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home.
