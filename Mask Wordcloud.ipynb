       "\"probably the best one. very good quality & comfortable . happy buying👍😃 i bought this because it looked good in the photos. what i received looks rather average. wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. breathing through it is very laboured. if you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled. at 150 bucks a pop, this is mostly a waste. i'll have to replace this with something else now. vertical size of mask is too smallhorizontal is comfortablelean guys can prefer not for big size guysouter material is cotton softinside the mask may be a filteryou cannot blow a cadle with this maskits safe** based on the facts its mentioned.good for lean or young guys very poor quality . 3 layer mask (packing says 6 layers ) .no return policy .you are stuck with what u buy .wouldn’t  recommend .definitely not giordano like probably the best one. very good quality & comfortable . happy buying👍😃 utter waste .. nothing better than a roadside mask..and above all non returnablecons:1. basic hosiery fabric2. stiff inner layer3. doesn't cover full lower face4. you breathe from nose gaps5. no nose clip for close fit on nose6. strings can't be used behind head7. achy on ears8. poor branding as printing isn't impressive9. packaging is pathetic as you get them in resealable pouches, so you can't be sure of the first hand use or of getting sealed packpros: nothing on pro sidei feel looted by just showing jiordano brand.. it’s of no use against corona as it doesn’t have a nose clip so the upper nose area is kind of open.no perfect fit. though the material is good, soft n breathable. it is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.it does not have a nose clip. so, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the mask. the fitting is also not good. might fit for people with broad faces.i used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. so, the filter is clearly not good. doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home. these masks do not fit!! these do not fit anyone at all - not me, my husband, mom - we all have very different head sizes and even then these are way too loose. reviews mention them being a bit tight so i'm thinking these differ batch to batch - making them a bit of a gamble. would not recommend i bought this because it looked good in the photos. what i received looks rather average. wearing the mask for any

mask. the fitting is also not good. might fit for people with broad faces.i used sanitizer to clean the inside of the mask first, and it soaked through and came out the outer end of the mask. so, the filter is clearly not good. doesn't feel like a 6-layered filtration.don't go for it if you want to buy it for pandemic situation.ok for use in kitchen and mild dusting at home. these masks do not fit!! these do not fit anyone at all - not me, my husband, mom - we all have very different head sizes and even then these are way too loose. reviews mention them being a bit tight so i'm thinking these differ batch to batch - making them a bit of a gamble. would not recommend before you use this mask, please cut this mask with scissors and see it with ur eyes that it’s just 3 layer mask. it’s hard to believe people selling so inferior product even during this difficult times. i don’t know how much money will be enough for these guys to actually start caring for humanity. probably the best one. very good quality & comfortable . happy buying👍😃 very poor quality . 3 layer mask (packing says 6 layers ) .no return policy .you are stuck with what u buy .wouldn’t  recommend .definitely not giordano like utter waste .. nothing better than a roadside mask..and above all non returnablecons:1. basic hosiery fabric2. stiff inner layer3. doesn't cover full lower face4. you breathe from nose gaps5. no nose clip for close fit on nose6. strings can't be used behind head7. achy on ears8. poor branding as printing isn't impressive9. packaging is pathetic as you get them in resealable pouches, so you can't be sure of the first hand use or of getting sealed packpros: nothing on pro sidei feel looted by just showing jiordano brand.. the quality is not that good, it's just simple cloth material, the ear loops are also small. it's more of style thing, with the brand name on the side of the mask probably the best one. very good quality & comfortable . happy buying👍😃 very poor quality

the material is good, soft n breathable. it is very attractive on the outside, but it is equally useless.it does not have a nose clip. so, there is plenty of gap for air and virus to enter through the

i received looks rather average. wearing the mask for any duration longer than 10 mins makes it uncomfortable. breathing through it is very laboured. if you talk through it, your voice sounds muffled.
